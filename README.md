## Tested Platform

- Windows 10 
- Visual Studio 2022 Professional
- AMD Ryzen 5950X
- 32GB Memory

## Dependencies
- CGAL 
- Eigen3
- Boost


**Important: Please using vcpkg to install dependent libraries! And please use  "git clone" to install vcpkg, otherwise you may get errors during CGAL installation.**

- .\vcpkg install boost:x64-windows

- .\vcpkg install cgal:x64-windows

  â€‹	use "git pull" if you get errors with the "gmp" library.

- .\vcpkg install Eigen3:x64-windows

- .\vcpkg integrate install



## MSVC on Windows

```
Download this project: NormalOrientation
```
Open Cmake-GUI

```
Where is the source code: NormalOrientation

Where to build the binaries: NormalOrientation/build
```

**Note: check the location of dependencies and install. It is recommended to use vcpkg to add dependencies.**

```
Configure->Generate->Open Project

ALL_BUILD -> Build
Turn Debug to Release -> ALL_BUILD -> Build
```

Please set `MAIN` as Startup Project, and make the following changes:

```
Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Code Generation -> 
- Enable Parallel Code Generation : Yes
- Enable Enhanced Instruction Set : AVX2
- Floating Point Model : Fast

Properties -> Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Language -> Open MP Support : Yes
```

## Test

- All examples are in `MAIN`. 
- All the files is in `NormalOrientation\data`. 
- The output files is in `NormalOrientation\data\Out\`.
- The result of operations are in `NormalOrientation\data\MyResult\`, for checking whether the program is running correctly.


### Important Tips: 

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ **Speed**
  
This code is not optimized for speed, but for clarity. Please open Openmp and AVX2 in Visual Studio to speed up the code.
Please set the floating point model to fast in Visual Studio to speed up the code.
The default number of Openmp parallel threads is 28, set according to an AMD Ryzen 5950x CPU, 
please set different number of threads according to the CPU you use to get the best running effect.

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ **Stop condition**

For viewing the optimization process in more detail, we have not set the optimization stop condition. Please manually stop the optimization and view all iteration results in the `data\out` folder
